The sum of all the internal angles of a triangle is always 180o no matter how the triangle is constructed.
The length of any side of a triangle is shorter than the sum of the other two sides. 
A triangle can always be split into two right triangles no matter how the triangle is constructed.
Different types of triangles

Basically there are 6 different types of triangles, 3 of them are classified according to the internal angles and the rest of them are classified according to the lengths of the sides.

Right triangle
A right triangle is a triangle that has a right angle, namely 90o. In a right triangle the opposite side to the right angle is called hypotenuse and the other sides are called catheti. 
Any right triangles obey obey the Pythagorean theorem, which is shown below:

a2 + b2 = c2

Acute triangle
In an acute triangle all there angles are less than 90o.

Obtuse triangle
In an obtuse triangle one of the angles is greater than 90o.

Equilateral triangle
A triangle is called an equilateral triangle when all 3 sides are equal in length. In an equilateral triangle, all internal angles are the same, namely 60o.

Isosceles triangle
A triangle is called an isosceles triangle when two sides are equal in length, also two of the internal angles are the same. If one of the angles is 45o then the triangle 
is also a right triangle.

Scalene triangle
A triangle is called a scalene triangle when all three internal angles are different from one another.
